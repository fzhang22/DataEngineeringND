# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres

## 1. Introduction
<p> A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
</p>
<p> In this project, my goal is to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. I'll apply data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. Particularly, I'll define fact and dimension tables of star schema for a particular analytic focus, then write an ETL pipeline transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## 2. Project Datasets
**Song Datasets** <br>
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.
After converted into DataFrame format, the attributes is shown as follow: <br>
![song_datasets](song_dataset.png "song dataset")

**Log Datasets**<br>
Each log file in JSON format generated by event simulator based on the songs in the dataset. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
After converted into DataFrame format, the attributes is shown as follow: <br>
![log_datasets](log_dataset.png "log dataset")

## 3. Data Modeling
Using the song and log datasets, a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis will be created. The ER-diagram is shown as follows:
![ER_diagram](ER_pic.png "ER diagram")

- Fact Table
  - **1. songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong` songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
- Dimension Tables
  - **2. users** - user in the app
   - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*
  - **3. songs** - songs in music database
   - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*
  - **4. artists** - artists in music database
   - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*
  - **5. time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
   - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## 4. ETL Pipeline
The detailed ETL process please checked this [Jupyter notebook file](etl.ipynb).

## 5. Usage
1. `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table to check the tables of database.
2. `create_tables.py` drops and creates the tables. Run this file to reset the tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
3. `etl.ipynb` reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4. `etl.py` reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
5. `sql_queries.py` contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.

 In terminal, firstly run `python create_tables.py` to create the **sparkifydb** database and then run `python etl.py` to generate the ETL pipeline, finally run `etl.ipynb` to check the new database.
